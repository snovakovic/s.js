s.js
======


Why should you use this lib?
You probably shouldnâ€™t! as there is much better and mature libraries out-there this is just personal collection of methods used over time, and helpers for pure js programming without any other libraries.

As that is said if you find any method inside useful please fell free to use it. 
All methods are under unit test so usage should be relatively secure. If you find any bug please provide info about it, or even better a solution :)
